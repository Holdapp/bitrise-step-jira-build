  Update JIRA issues with build number

  Update fields of JIRA issues with build number.
description: |-
  Update fields of JIRA issues associated with current MR/PR, with the current build number.

  ### How does it work?
  
  First, the step needs to know tasks associated with the build, so it examines Git history of the merge that it was triggered by. 
  Each merge request can have multiple tasks related to it. So step extracts all the messages of commits involved from the merge commit, 
  and it looks for task keys using a predefined format (for example, [ABCD-1234]). Then using JIRA API, it updates custom fields of these tasks with current build number. 

  Additionally step can keep ticket history from failed/aborted builds. It uses Bitrise API to gather information about the commits 
  from all aborted or failed builds preceding the current one.

        If you develop an iOS project, you can extract the version number from Info.plist of the main target. It’s called `CFBundleShortVersionString`. 
        Alternatively, you may use a custom step that can do it for you: [bitrise-step-xcode-build-version](https://github.com/nodes-ios/bitrise-step-xcode-build-version)
